# 2023-2024 Plate Discipline Correlation Matrices
This is a work in progress as of 11/12/24 - a lot is subject to change here!

## Intro
I saw a Reddit post from ~10 years ago regarding plate discipline metrics that said that Z-Swing%/Swing% was a HIGHLY effective plate discipline metric, correlating at highly with BB%.
The formula:

        (Z-Swing%)          = (number of pitches a hitter swings at inside the strike zone) / (pitches in the zone)
        (Swing%)            = (number of pitches a hitter swings at) / (number of pitches seen)
        (Z-Swing%)/(Swing%) = [(number of pitches a hitter swings at inside the strike zone) * (pitches in the zone)] / [(number of pitches a hitter swings at) * (number of pitches seen)] 

I wanted to see how well this holds up in recent years, and if there are good indicators from ratios of other metrics as well. 

## Goal
My goal is to create correlation matrices for ratios of plate discipline metrics, with data from 2023 and 2024.
